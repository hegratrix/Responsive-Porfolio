            <p>It has been said that you can't teach a dog new tricks.  In my life, I have found that statement to be untrue.  I am proud to say I am 44 years old and have spent these years learning and growing.  Not that I'm a dog, but in the last 5 years I may have learned more new tricks then in many of the previous years.</p>
            <p>I am a wife and mother of 4 kids. That is a learning experience all on its own!  I have spent the last 22+ years as a stay-at-home mom raising two fantastic sons and two wonderful daughters.  As a parent, you learn love, patience, understanding, juggling, biting your tongue, cooking, cleaning, and oh so many life skills. During this time, I was still involved in my community spending time in service at both church and my children's school.  At church, I started teaching Sunday School to 4 year olds.  Then I was asked to help run the whole children's program.  That was a little intimidating, not because of the kids, but there were adults involved!  I spent my life up to this point very shy and happily working in the background without attention called to me.  I was involved in the PTA at my kids school, but always in the background as a worker bee.  I loved being involved and hoped I went unnoticed by the adults.  I received a PTA Honorary Service Award with the comment made that people would be surprised how much I did because I worked quietly in the background.</p> 
            <p>Seven years ago I made a decision that I think really changed the course of my life.  I decided to be the PTA President at my children's elementary school.  Anyone who knew me was shocked at my decision, as was I.  I'm still not sure how I came to volunteer.  However, once I set my mind to something, I commit.  I went to PTA convention, studied the bylaws, read the PTA toolkit and researched every question I could come up with.  I needed to approach this job with understanding, authority, and confidence.  I decided I had spent too much time being self-conscious and that if I was going to succeed, I would have to fake it until I made it.  That is what I did and before I knew it, I didn't have to fake it.  During my two years serving as President, I was impressed by my own transformation.  My top accomplishment is that I discovered I work really well with people and enjoyed coming out of the shadows.  I now love public speaking and take any opportunity to grab a microphone and teach or talk to groups of people.  I found a new level of confidence I had lacked before.</p>
            <p>Now that my children are older, I'm on to my next adventure and learning opportunity.  I just recently discovered coding and I love it!  I learned about coding bootcamps from a friend in a casual conversation and it piqued my attention.  It sounded like something I would both enjoy and be good at.  I researched it and found a program through University California of Irvine's Department of Continuing Education.  It was both a challenge and a thrill.  Now I'm ready to begin a career in a field I'm ready to love.  I have had the opportunity to share my experiences and teach coding lessons in assemblies and class presentations at the elementary school.  It is fun to share my passion with the kids and see them get excited with the possibilities.</p>
